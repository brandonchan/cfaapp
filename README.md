##Code For America Challenge
This is a challege where building violations of in the form of csv was given. 
I parsed through the csv to find the number of violations in each category, as well as the earliest and latest violation.
I conducted this challenge with ruby.
To run the app, from the command line in the root directory of this repo type in, 

```
ruby buildingcodeviolations.rb
```

This should output sentences of how many times a category occured, and the earliest and latest date.

I completed this challenge by creating a class called Building_Violations and creating various methods with respect to S.O.L.I.D. principles. 
The methods are already called upon the bottom of the ruby file.
